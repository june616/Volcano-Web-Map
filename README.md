# Volcano-Web-Map
Created an interactive web map application which shows volcano locations using Python Folium and Pandas library. 

The map has 3 layers: base map layer, polygon layer (represents population of the countries), point layer (with dots), you can turn on and off these layers. 

It also shows the elevation value of each volcano that erupted using the popup on each volcano point.
